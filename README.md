Security Audit Overview
Purpose: A security audit aims to identify vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and security weaknesses in a blockchain network. This process is essential to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the blockchain system.

Key Components of a Blockchain Security Audit:
Smart Contract Analysis:

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They can contain bugs or vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. Tools like Slither perform static analysis to detect such issues.

Consensus Mechanism Assessment:

The consensus mechanism is the process by which a blockchain network validates transactions and adds them to the ledger. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Ensuring the mechanism is secure helps prevent attacks like the 51% attack, where an attacker gains control over the majority of the networkâ€™s mining or staking power.

Network Infrastructure Evaluation:

This involves reviewing the nodes, APIs, and overall network configuration. The goal is to ensure resilience against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other network-based threats.
